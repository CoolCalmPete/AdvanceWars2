Netwars is an Advance Wars clone for the PC platform. It is advanced, but not playable yet.

Most of the code was written almost a year in the past, when I was not very experienced and just learning C++, so don't  expect very beautiful code ;)
It depends on boost, gtkmm and libglademm, you should have them if you want to compile this game.
A map for testing (bla.aws) is included. You can create your own maps with the Advance Wars Map Editor (<http://advancewarsnet.com/designmaps/editor.php>)

If you are interested in this project, drop me an email at <thekenny123@gmail.com> or send me a message on github (<http://github.com/The-Kenny>)


PS:
Much comments in the source (and the entire changelog) are in german. Sorry for that.
