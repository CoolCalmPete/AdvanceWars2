Netwars is an Advance Wars clone for the PC platform. It is advanced, but not complete yet.

Most of the core-code was written almost a year in the past, when I was not very experienced and just learning C++, so don't expect very beautiful code ;-)

A map for testing is included. You can create your own maps with the [Advance Wars Map Editor][]

If you are interested in this project, drop me an email at <ulrich.moritz@gmail.com> or send me a message on [Github][]
