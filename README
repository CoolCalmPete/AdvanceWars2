Netwars


Netwars is an Advance Wars clone for "real" PCs. It is advanced, but not playable.

Most of the code was written almost a year in the past, and I'm not the best C++-Developer of the world.
The layout of the source tree and much of the code in it is just crap.
I think it should be refactored, but I don't have the motivation for it. Maybe in the future ;)

PS:
Much in this repo is german and much is english, sorry for that.
